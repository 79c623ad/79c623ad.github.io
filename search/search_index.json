This talk will explore innovative strategies and technologies that are shaping the future of L&amp;D in modern workplace, empowering employees to continuously grow and adapt.</p> <p>The Cambodia L&amp;D Talk is an event that provides a vibrant platform for attendees to connect, gain valuable insights, and engage in discussions about innovative solutions that can enhance organizational success through effective L&amp;D Practices. With keynote presentations and sessions led by distinguished speakers, this event aims to establish unprecedented benchmarks within the L&amp;D community. It specifically focuses on contemporary challenges, digital transformations, and strategic upskilling.</p> <p>Research has consistently shown that employees who have access to continuous learning opportunities are more likely to feel motivated, engaged, and committed to their organizations. L&amp;D programs that are tailored to individual needs and career aspirations can not only enhance employees' skills and knowledge but also demonstrate the organization's investment in their professional growth. This, in turn, boosts employee morale and satisfaction, leading to higher levels of employee engagement and ultimately improving retention rates.</p> <p>Event Agenda: 8:30 AM - Registration &amp; Networking 9:30 AM - Session on Learning in Moderin Workplace by Steven (Savath Kuch), Managing Director of EDI 10:15 AM - Tea Break 10:40 AM - Digital Talent Acceleration by Ts.
